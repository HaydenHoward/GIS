# Overview
GIS
I wanted to learn the basics of GIS. In this project I decided to put markers down on a basic map and put descriptions and a title for each marker. 

To use this you need to access the github pages of it to veiw the map. 

In this project I wanted to document different activities that are in the town that I am in that can be done. I put restuarants and other activites for this.

# Development Environment

I used ArcGIS to help me set up my map in my HTML and my JavaScript. I also used google maps to find the location of differnt restuarants and activities I marked on the map.
